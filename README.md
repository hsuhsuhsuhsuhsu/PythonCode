  and try to know the number of store that were nearby each apartment.<br>
  And we measured a score of house interior of every apartment depends on how much furniture inside the house.<br>
  
## Deep Learning Application
  Text emotion dection - Using the post on twitter, applied on machine learning modelsc (SVM, logistic regression)<br> 
  and deep learning model (CNN), predict the emotion of the post.<br>
  
  Speech emotion dection - Using datasets with labels provided by professional agency, applied on CNN to predict the emotion of the short sentence speech.
